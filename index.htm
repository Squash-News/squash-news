      Venue of Legends</h1>
    <p class="style6"><img src="images/west_totton_centre_exterior.jpg" width="190" height="134" border="1" /><br />
      <br />
    <span class="style9">The West Totton Astra Dome is the UK's premier arena for seeing top, top quality players, exhibiting world class squash. Former UK No.1, Peter Nicol is quoted as saying &quot;If I only have one regret in my international career, it's that I never got to play at The West Totton Astra Dome&quot;.</span><br />
      <br />
      <img src="images/west_totton_centre_interior.jpg" width="190" height="134" border="1" /><br />
      <br />
    <span class="style9">Come and see what all the fuss is about. On Thursday evenings there is said to be no hotter venue. Reserve a court on 02380 861712 or come and catch the action at Hazel Farm Road, Totton, Southampton, Hampshire, SO40 8WU.<br />

      <span class="style11">Durks Senior hits comeback trail as BigBoy Extender makes welcome return to action.</span><br />
</h1>
    <p align="justify" class="style13">There was some heavy hitting on show this evening (17.07.08) as Durks, Durks Snr, Marston and Pollinger tore up Courts 3 and 4 and re-wrote the rule book on epic squash. <br />
      Fans were treated to some spectacular rallies and 100% commitment from these top, top quality players. In short, it was World Class. <br />
    </p>
    <h2 class="style9">'Good to be back' remarks Durks Snr.</h2>
    <p class="style13">After several weeks off the squash-radar or squashdar, as it's become known, Rich Durkin was welcomed back into the comforting bosom of The Astra Dome this evening, although facing the twin guns of Durks Jnr and Pollinger proved to be a baptism of fire for the likeable tat-worshipper. <br />
    &quot;Those guys were on form tonight&quot; quipped an exhausted looking Durks, &quot;But form is temporary and class is permanent&quot;. It is thought, that Durks Snr, seen exiting the Astra Dome in The Chimp Mobile, was heading to a high-altitude training camp and will be back to challenge at the very top level next week. </p>
    <h2 class="style9">Marston continues winning run. Should we break his legs? </h2>
    <p class="style13">Rubber-legs Marston continued to write himself into Astra Dome history this evening with some cross court belters on courts 3 and 4. Another epic battle with Durks Jnr ended 14-12 after a tie-break and the gangly squash ninja went to another decider with Pollinger, taking that by a close margin also. It is widely thought that Durks and Pollinger will be embarking on some intense gun training this weekend, in a bid to halt his progress. </p>
    <h2 class="style9"> Pollinger: Fitter, Happier, More Productive....</h2>
    <p class="style13">Just don't mention the iPhone 2.0. After some ball-busting gymnasium action, Pollinger has declared himself in &quot;The best shape of my career&quot;. O2's most famous sponsor is revelling in his new-found fitness and admits that the ladies are liking what they're seeing. &quot;I've taken to beating the ladies out of my store with a stick&quot;, he commented, &quot;They just can't get enough of the guns&quot;. Squash News has certainly had plenty of fan mail. We filed it under 'C' for Complete bollocks. </p>
    <h2 class="style9">Buckley. Have a word with yourself.</h2>
    <p class="style9"><span class="style13">A no-show from Tombo 'Iceman' Buckley was again discussed with the President of The West Totton Astra Dome, Alex this evening, who declared that the lack of commitment from the big man was 'sickening'.<br />
    &quot;The public, whilst loving tonight's action, and the genius that is www.squash-news.co.uk, are thoroughly disgruntled and are starting to vote with their feet.&quot; It is thought that membership to Tommi's fanclub 'KissMyGuns.com&quot; is down a record 42% on last year. </span></p>
    <h2 class="style9">New ideas to be put forward in online meeting.</h2>
    <p class="style13">Some new ideas for squash-news.co.uk have already begun to hit the mailbox, with a section for Squash WAGS, An administrative Top Trump card for Alex and More tits and arse, just some of the suggestions. Squash News will be taking all of these ideas on board for the next Squash News Online Forum, in three months time. Chief Editor, Kev Durks is said to want the site to &quot;Evolve into a interactive squash forum, the likes of which has never been seen before&quot;. Pollinger was said to 'have wood' at the very prospect that squash-news.co.uk could actually get any better. </p>
    <p class="style13"><strong>NEXT GAME: Thursday 24th July 2008. 9:20. 2 x Courts.</strong> <br />
      You can't possibly rule the court from your armchair, so get on it. <span class="style13"><a href="mailto:Northshore78@googlemail.com"><br />
